            <p>
              At SarthiQ, we collaborate with educational institutions to
              empower students for the AI age. In today's rapidly evolving
              world, students need more than just traditional career
              counsellingâ€”they need AI literacy, career awareness, and
              interest-based career paths to be industry-ready by the time they
              graduate.
